* Castellan: Org Agenda manager

Castellan provides an alternative UI to org-mode agendas.  It shows two TODO panels:
- _scheduled TODOs_, which have a start date attached
- _activity TODOs_, which are (or should be) tied to some _activity_.

The project is currently bare-bones usable but in its early stages.

** Installation

There is no official package, so you will have to copy ~todo.el~ into
a suitable place.  Set up the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
; Agenda inbox.  In the future, this will be used for quick-capture.
  (setq castellan-agenda-inbox "my-agenda-inbox.org")
; All relevant TODO lists.
  (setq castellan-agenda-todos '("agenda1.org" "agenda2.org"))
; Calendar items that shouldn't be part of the activity TODO.
  (setq castellan-agenda-calendars '("calendar.org"))
#+END_SRC

** Usage
You can use weekly schedule construction with the following types of
org hierarchies:

#+BEGIN_SRC
* #2023
** # W01
*** ## Mon
**** TODO =12:00 | lunch at noon
*** ## Tuesday
#+END_SRC

** Plans
- time tracking
- activity tracking: can schedule blocks for an activity, and starting that activity will prioritise TODO items that are part of that activity
- effort estimation
- visual calendar overviews
- auto-archiving
- mu4e integration
