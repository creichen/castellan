org-time-string-to-time: This function takes an Org-mode time string (like those used in "SCHEDULED" or "DEADLINE" properties) and converts it into the Emacs time format.

format-time-string: Once you have a time in Emacs time format, you can use this function to convert it into a custom string format.

Arithmetic on Times: For performing arithmetic on times, you can use functions like time-add, time-subtract, and seconds-to-time.
